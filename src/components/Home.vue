            world through personalized language learning. Above all, we value
            multicultural communication, friendship, and long-lasting
            relationships between students and teachers. We strive to teach with
            the best digital resources available and are commited to adjusting
            our curriculums to fit students' needs and goals. After all, we
            founded Manabu to make language learning fun and rewarding.

            Manabu is a technology-focused organization based in Singapore. We
            started from a small community of Japanese teachers and hope to
            build a global community of language learners. We believe that
            fluency can be achieved through intensive learning and everyday
            communication. This idea is reflected in our learning portal, as we
            have developed tools to aid Japanese learning: we provide shared
            lesson materials, in-depth data reporting on student progress, and
            extensive feedback to help students overcome their weaknesses.

                Your progress is hard to measure unless you take an exam. Your
                effort cannot be seen, the time you spent is not visible, but
                what if you could see everything? We will analyze your progress
                from many aspects and visualize your effort. As you progress the
                character will move forward on the progress bar.ã€€Completely
                record and analyze lesson progress and student growth. Since we
                are in charge of that part, we can concentrate on teaching, and
                it is possible to make a full-scale lesson plan using data etc.

                faster improvement, but of course you can create your own
                schedule and arrange the time of the lessons based on your
                preference. If you would like casual lessons such as one lesson
                a week, please let me know! We can figure it out too!
