Lessons are always enjoyable and have helped me leaps and bounds ‚ù§Ô∏è My listening and speaking skills have definitely improved since I first started and it‚Äôs all thanks to the lovely Rina Sensei! Misa-san is also always so willing to extend a helpful hand whenever I need anything.

In fact, frequent lessons boosted my self-confidence so much that I can now comfortably immerse myself in the language and culture without being afraid of making mistakes. I love how friendly my teachers are, especially Hiromi and Rui sensei. They taught me how to express myself in different ways, where I was able to learn how to explain my work, hobbies/interests, and dreams in Japanese. I highly recommend Manabu and cannot wait to see more of their resources and technology in the future!"

I just felt very relaxed and confident in every lesson. Each time I got questions, Misa sensei and Rina sensei, helped me and clarified everything right away. The teachers are very friendly and accommodating. It was worth it and such a great chance for me to improve my Japanese skill. Once again, thank you very much for accommodating me. I have high hopes and best wishes for your school. I hope you can reach out to more students because you have a unique and effective support for Japanese learners like me."

I‚Äôve taken group Japanese classes at my university in Singapore as well as in Tokyo itself, but my one-to-one classes with Manabu are my favourite thus far ü•≥ I really appreciate the individualised and tailored lesson plans that they make to suit each student‚Äôs needs, as well as the affordable daily lessons that keep my brain working. I find it easier to memorise words and vocab when I‚Äôm constantly exposed to Japanese, rather than taking 2 1.5 hour classes twice a week (as I did in University) and getting burnt out + confused really fast. I‚Äôm very fortunate to have found Manabu Lessons online and look forward to continuing to improve my Japanese ‚ú®‚ú®"
